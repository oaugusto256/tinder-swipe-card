## Tested with

The application was tested using a iOS(iPhone 6S) device, unfortunately I don't have a Android device to test the app with it.

## How to use and test

_PS: It's necessary that you have a mobile device that has Expo app, and a computer that can run the Expo CLI._

Clone the repository to a folder of your choice, redirect to the cloned repository and execute the following command:

```javascript
yarn install
```

After the installation of the libs and dependencies, start the project executing the command:

```javascript
yarn start
```

Use the mobile device camera to scan the QRCode and run the project.
